h2#events Events
p Swiper comes with a bunch of useful events you can listen. Events can be assigned in two ways:
ol
  li
    p Using <code>on</code> parameter on swiper initialization:
    p
      pre
        code
          :code
            var mySwiper = new Swiper('.swiper-container', {
              // ...
              on: {
                init: function () {
                  console.log('swiper initialized');
                },
              },
            };
  li
    p Using <code>on</code> method after swiper initialization.
    p
      pre
        code
          :code
            var mySwiper = new Swiper('.swiper-container', {
              // ...
            };
            mySwiper.on('slideChange', function () {
              console.log('slide changed');
            });

  p Please note, that <code>this</code> keyword within event handler always points to Swiper instance

        p Event will be fired right after Swiper initialization. Note that with <code>swiper.on('init')</code> syntax it will work only in case you set <code>init: false</code> parameter:
        pre
          code
            :code
              var swiper = new Swiper('.swiper-container', {
                init: false,
                // other parameters
              })
              swiper.on('init', function() { /* do something */ });
              // init Swiper
              swiper.init();
        p Otherwise use it as the parameter:
        pre
          code
            :code
              var swiper = new Swiper('.swiper-container', {
                // other parameters
                on: {
                  init: function () {
                    /* do something */
