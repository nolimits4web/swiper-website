title: Getting Started With Swiper
---

## Installation

There are few options on how to include/import Swiper into your project:

### Install from NPM

We can install Swiper from NPM

```
  $ npm install swiper
```

```js
  // import Swiper JS
  import Swiper from 'swiper';
  // import Swiper styles
  import 'swiper/swiper-bundle.css';

  const swiper = new Swiper(...);
```

By default Swiper exports only core version without additional modules (like Navigation, Pagination, etc.). So you need to import and configure them too:

```js
  // core version + navigation, pagination modules:
  import SwiperCore, { Navigation, Pagination } from 'swiper/core';

  // configure Swiper to use modules
  SwiperCore.use([Navigation, Pagination]);

  // init Swiper:
  const swiper = new Swiper(...);
```

If you want to import Swiper with all modules (bundle) then it should be imported from `swiper/bundle`:

```js
  // import Swiper bundle with all modules installed
  import Swiper from 'swiper/bundle';

  // init Swiper:
  const swiper = new Swiper(...);
```

### Use Swiper from CDN

If you don't want to include Swiper files in your project, you may use it from CDN. The following files are available:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/swiper/swiper-bundle.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/swiper/swiper-bundle.min.css" />

<script src="https://unpkg.com/swiper/swiper-bundle.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/swiper/swiper-bundle.min.js"></script>
```

If you use ES modules in browser, there is a CDN version for that too:

```html
<script type="module">
  import Swiper from 'https://unpkg.com/swiper/swiper-bundle.esm.browser.min.js'

  const swiper = new Swiper(...)
</script>
```

### Download assets

If you want to use Swiper assets locally, you can directly download them from https://unpkg.com/swiper/

## Add Swiper HTML Layout

Now, we need to add basic Swiper layout to our app:

```html
<!-- Slider main container -->
<div class="swiper-container">
  <!-- Additional required wrapper -->
  <div class="swiper-wrapper">
    <!-- Slides -->
    <div class="swiper-slide">Slide 1</div>
    <div class="swiper-slide">Slide 2</div>
    <div class="swiper-slide">Slide 3</div>
    ...
  </div>
  <!-- If we need pagination -->
  <div class="swiper-pagination"></div>

  <!-- If we need navigation buttons -->
  <div class="swiper-button-prev"></div>
  <div class="swiper-button-next"></div>

  <!-- If we need scrollbar -->
  <div class="swiper-scrollbar"></div>
</div>
```

## Swiper CSS Styles/Size

In addition to <a href="/api/#styles" target="_blank">Swiper's CSS styles</a>, we may need to add some custom styles to set Swiper size:

```css
.swiper-container {
  width: 600px;
  height: 300px;
}
```

## Initialize Swiper

Finally, we need to initialize Swiper in JS:

```js
const swiper = new Swiper('.swiper-container', {
  // Optional parameters
  direction: 'vertical',
  loop: true,

  // If we need pagination
  pagination: {
    el: '.swiper-pagination',
  },

  // Navigation arrows
  navigation: {
    nextEl: '.swiper-button-next',
    prevEl: '.swiper-button-prev',
  },

  // And if we need scrollbar
  scrollbar: {
    el: '.swiper-scrollbar',
  },
});
```
